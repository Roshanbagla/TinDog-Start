# Tindog

Created a responsive webpage using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. This project was created as a part of online course that I have been doing: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/

The website is deployed on AWS: https://master.d33yll0b83sl5n.amplifyapp.com/
